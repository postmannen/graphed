# TODO

## Node data compression

## HASH/Checksum of node, tamper protection

## Built-in version control of node data

## Time index

### Add a timestamp field to log entry nodes

### Implement a dedicated time index (hashmap or tree structure depending on query patterns)

### Time-bucket approach if you typically query logs by day/hour ranges
